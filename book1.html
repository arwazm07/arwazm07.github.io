   <p>Set in the culturally rich landscape of 1961 Sindh, Pakistan, this story traces the emotionally layered journey of Fatima, a young, graceful woman whose life is changed forever by love, loss, and resilience. Married to Akmal, Fatima embraces motherhood with the birth of their son, Ali, only to find herself facing tragedy when Akmal passes away unexpectedly.
What unfolds is a quiet yet powerful year of transformation. As Fatima struggles to rebuild her life, she is supported by Kasim, a kind-hearted man connected to her through family ties. Their relationship begins with distance, duty, and silence—but as time passes, affection blossoms in the smallest of moments: a bowl of soup, a shared prayer, or a late-night conversation during Ramzan.
Through seasonal shifts, festivals, illness, recovery, and the rhythms of domestic life, the book beautifully explores how two people—both carrying their own histories—gradually create a new home, not just for themselves, but for the little boy they both love.</p>
